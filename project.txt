In all states except for D3(cold), the PCI Express link is placed into L1 or a supported L1 Substate (L1.1 or L1.2). Power is not removed from the Endpoint, although it is required to self-manage power consumption. PCI config space is available, and the link will return to L0 in order to service config read and write transactions. The link also returns to L0 when an Endpoint generates a wake event, which it does by sending an in-band PME message upstream. Commands to enter D0-D3 are accomplished by a config write transaction to a field in the Power Management Capability Structure, the Power Management Control and Status Register (PMCSR).  Entry of a PCI Express Endpoint (EP) to D3(cold) occurs at the parent Downstream Port (DP), usually a Root Port (RP). The DP will only be commanded to enter D3 once all children are in D3(hot) and are prepared to enter D3(cold). Generally the Power Resource referenced by _PR3 is turned off at the end of the DP D3 entry sequence, and the _OFF method within that Power Resource is responsible for the D3(cold) entry sequence for endpoints beneath the DP.

The mechanism to invoke this sequence is device-specific, and may be available via controls/registers within the root/downstream port. Once this completes, fundamental reset (e.g. PERST#) is driven to the PCIe Endpoint, taking the link to L2 or L3. In D3(cold) core power is permitted to be removed.   The PCIe reference clock should be turned off, since the assertion of PERST# to a PCIe Endpoint caused the Endpoint to disable its clock power management feature, such that the Endpoint will drive CLKREQ# thereby requesting the reference clock.     If an Endpoint is not armed for wake, all of its power may be removed.   Some PCIe form factors (such as M.2) define a single power rail, which acts as the auxiliary power rail. This rail may be turned off only if the Endpoint is not armed for wake.   An example of a PCI Express Root Port and connected Endpoint supporting D3(cold) is shown here.

While its Resource Descriptor object (_CRS) may reference one or more bus controllers, within ACPI and OSPM there is not a strict parent-child relationship like there is for PCI and USB. Therefore, SPB devices and controllers can be placed into D-states independently of each other.  Additionally, some SPB devices (like SPI and I2C) may reside on an electrical connection shared by other devices. In order to power-manage these devices independently of other devices, there may need to be some sort of on-board signal isolation used to prevent interference with devices sharing the same electrical connections.  For devices that have independent power controls, using a Power Resource object is optional. _PS0/1/2/3 control methods can be used directly. For a device that supports D0 and D3, it would include Control Methods similar to the ones shown in the code sample here.   Alternatively, Power Resource objects referenced by _PR0, _PR2, and _PR3 can be used instead, where the _ON would be equivalent to the _PS0 method, and _OFF would be equivalent to _PS3. Power Resources must be used where multiple devices share a single power control.
